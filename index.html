            <p class="fs19 ws">Welcome to our 30th <span class="orange">meta</span> report! The “nerf” to <span class="blue">King of Beggars</span>  didn’t change much and <span class="orange">SY</span>  continues to reign supreme.
            While <span class="orange">Assimilate</span>  and <span class="blue">Battle Trance</span> are in a good spot,
            <span class="blue">Guerilla Tactics</span> took a huge hit with the nerf to <span class="blue">Milva: Sharpshooter</span>. As such, the green faction is barely worth mentioning.</p>
            <p class="fs19 ws">With <span class="orange">ST</span> out of the picture, we could see the return of <span class="orange">NR</span> and <span class="orange">MO</span> decks, namely <span class="blue">Inspired Zeal</span>, <span class="blue">Blood Scent</span> and <span class="blue">Carapace</span>.
            <span class="orange">SK</span> still has some <span class="orange">greedier </span>options like <span class="blue">Rage of the Sea</span> and <span class="orange">NG</span> players have a compelling
            reason to play <span class="blue">Tactical Decision </span>after the buffs to <span class="blue">Roach</span> and <span class="blue">Knickers</span> - be it <span class="orange">Hyperthin</span> or Cloggers.</p>
            <p class="fs19 ws">We will update the report regularly in order to provide the community with a spot-on representation of the current meta.

                            to improve your odds against control decks. <span class="blue">Siege Masters</span> will <span class="orange">Summon</span> themselves from your hand and draw a card when you play a Siege Engine,
                            creating a pocket for <span class="blue">Raffard’s Vengeance</span>. Flexible gold cards like <span class="blue">Chapter of Wizards</span> and <span class="blue">Gerhart of Aelle provide</span> you with a multitude of 
                            options, while <span class="blue">Seltkirk of Gulet</span> and <span class="blue">Margarita Laux-Antille</span> allow you to deal with the opposing threats. -EuronCrowsEye
